# AstroGann — Progress

Update at the end of every work session. Newest session on top.

## Current state

- **Current phase:** Phase 2 — Database (next to start)
- **Last finished phase:** Phase 1 — Project setup (2026-10-06)

## Next steps
1. Phase 2: migrations for all tables in docs/DATABASE.md, enums, models, factories, seeders; `migrate:fresh --seed`.

## Known issues / notes
- PHP 8.2.12 → Laravel 12 (Laravel 13 needs PHP 8.3). PHP 8.2 security support ends 2026-12-31 (D-01).
- Composer 2.4.4 is old; `composer self-update` recommended (D-02).
- DB is MariaDB 10.4 (D-03).
- Image has 7 panels, not 8 (D-06).
